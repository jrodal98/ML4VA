This project aimed to find a strategy for where citizens of Charlottesville should and shouldnâ€™t park
illegally based on local parking ticket data as well as predict if a ticket appeal will be successful. We
first cleaned our data which involved geocoding and date/time format standardization and then we
plotted a map that shows the distribution parking tickets in Charlottesville. Classification models
were used to predict whether or not a parking ticket is appealed based on various factors leading to
the initial ticketing. Through this project, we gained valuable insights about parking ticket patterns in
Charlottesville.

Our report is in the `preprint.pdf` file.
